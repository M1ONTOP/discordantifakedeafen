# A simple script for your discord bot to monitor VCs for deafened/fakedeafened users, it automatically server deafens them if they deafen themself and un-server deafens them when they unmute their mic. 
great for those sneaky people that use modded discord plugins to look like theyre deafened when really theyre listening in the whole time.


- note it has no variables so i can only monitor one VC at a time, if you want it to be able to monnitor all VCs you will have to change to script and add a variable to cater to that.
